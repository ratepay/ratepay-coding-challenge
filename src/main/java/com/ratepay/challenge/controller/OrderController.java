     * The endpoint should perform the following tasks:
     * 1. Save the OrderDto as an Order entity in the database.
     * 2. Check if the associated Buyer exists. If not, throw a custom exception.
     * 3. Calculate and set the total amount for the Order based on the products and their prices.
     *
     * Ensure that the implementation follows best practices, handles exceptions gracefully, and provides meaningful responses.
